Solution to the problem of MUMPS
use ubuntu version. pre-compiled binary is ok. Just don't use the parallel version. Still cannot
figure out why its not working; eventhough I managed to build my own.

By using the serial version and dynamic linking, problem solved!

-ldmumps_seq -lmumps_common_seq -lpord_seq 

No need for 
-lmpiseq_seq-4.10.0

All libdmumps_seq, libmumps_common_seq, libpord_seq are runned on multi-threads.
To control threads number, limit GOTO_NUM_THREADS thread counts of the environment.

$export GOTO_NUM_THREADS=what-number-you-want-to-limit

At first, I thought the libblas library and OpenMP threads were controlling the thread 
counts, but that is not the case.
